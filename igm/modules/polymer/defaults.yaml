        label: Polymer restraints
        role: group
        tip: Polymer restraints for consecutive beads in the same chromosome
        
        contact_range:
            label: Contact range
            role: line
            dtype: [float]
            
            default: 2.0
            min: 1.0
            tip: The contact range for 2 beads are considered in contact
            description: >
                Two beads are considered in contact when their distance is `contact_range` times the sum
                of their hard-core radiuses.
            
        polymer_bonds_style:
            label: Polymer bond style
            role: select
            dtype: [str]
            
            candidates: ['simple', 'hic', 'none']
            default: simple
            tip: The polymeric bond style to apply.
            description: >
                The polymeric bond style to apply. If set to `simple` (the default), successive beads in a 
                chromosome are restrained to be closer than the `contact_range` distance. If set to `hic`, 
                it will use Hi-C information to set distances accordingly to the probability values. If set 
                to `none`, successive bead contacts are not imposed.

            default: 1.0
            min: 0.0
            tip: Polymeric bond restraint force constant
            description: > 
                The force constant for polymeric bond.
